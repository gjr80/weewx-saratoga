Below are the default schemas for the WeeWX-Saratoga archive table and
WeeWX-Saratoga supplementary database supp table. They are only used for
initialization, or in conjunction with the wee_database --create-database and
--reconfigure options. Otherwise, once the tables are created the schema is
obtained dynamically from the database. Although a type may be listed here, it
may not necessarily be supported by your weather station hardware.

You may trim this list of any unused types if you wish, but it will not result
in saving as much space as you may think - most of the space is taken up by the
primary key indexes (type "dateTime").
