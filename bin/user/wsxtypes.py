    This XType supports calculation of scalars fo the following types:

    -   Wet bulb temperature
    -   Air density
    -   Absolute humidity
    -   Chandler Burning Index (CBI)
    -   Easter date
    -   Davis forecast text

    Each type to be calculated requires a method named calc_type() where 'type'
    is the name of the type to be calculated. The method must use the following
    signature:

    def calc_type(self, obs_type, record, db_manager):

    where:
        'obs_type' is the name of the type to be calculated
        'record' is a dict containing the current loop packet or archive record
        'db_manager' is a database manager

    The method may be declared static in which case 'self' should be removed.
    Additional types may be supported by adding an appropriately named
    calc_type method.

    The calculation of aggregates and series for supported types is not
    supported.
